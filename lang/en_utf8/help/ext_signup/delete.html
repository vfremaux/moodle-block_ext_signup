<h3>Deleting requests silently</h3>

<p>This command will definitely delete a request from the database without any advice to the submitter. No email is sent to user, including if globally deleted. Note that a user deleted with no previous mention in the database (first incomer) will have his user acocunt completely deleted
in the Moodle database, thus any further mention to that user will not be available anymore.</p>
